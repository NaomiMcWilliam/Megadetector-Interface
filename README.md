# Megadetector-Interface
## Introduction
GUI created for the Microsoft Megadetector, as a part of my internship at ZSL.

This GUI is only compatible with Windows.

The application is around 4GB after installation.



## Installation

Download SetupMD.exe to download the interface. 
You will have to click a few boxes, to allow the application to install.


For example:

Click on 'Don't Run'

Click on 'Run anyway'


Check below if you are having issues while running it on a Virtual machine of Windows.

Then, you can click Next and choose where to put the folder. The current path is the recommended place to put this application.
After this installation, another window should pop up with the words 'Installer'. This is installing additional folders, and can take some time (around 10-20 minutes).

###Virtual Machine help
At first it will install it to your downloads, but due to running it in a virtual machine the path to downloads can be quite complex. You will need to move the SetupMD.exe directly to the C: drive for example, and run it from there.


###Older Windows help
You may need to install curl if you are running on anything other than a Windows 10 upwards version.


## Running
Once it has finished installing, go to where the folder has been created.
Usually this will be in the C Drive unless the path was changed. Click on 'MegaDetectorGUI', 'Program', 'RUN_GUI' with the flamingo icon. This should open the application, where the process of using the MegaDetector is explained :).

(Currently it will also open the Command Prompt, to enable you to quit the application fully, but this is to be changed in future versions.)

To close the application, click QUIT on the interface. (You will also need to click 'X' on the Command Prompt that has opened, but this is to be changed in future versions.)
