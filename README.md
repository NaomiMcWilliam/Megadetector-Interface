# Megadetector-Interface
## Introduction
GUI created for the Microsoft Megadetector, as a part of my internship at ZSL.

This GUI is only compatible with Windows.

The application is around 4GB after installation.



## Installation

Download SetupMD.exe to download the interface. 
You will have to click a few boxes, to allow the application to install.


For example:

Click on 'Don't Run'

Click on 'Run anyway'




Then, you can click Next and choose where to put the folder. The current path is the recommended place to put this application.
After this installation, another window should pop up with the words 'Installer'. This is installing additional folders, and can take some time (around 10-20 minutes).

Once it has finished installing, go to where the folder has been created.
Usually this will be in the C Drive unless the path was changed. Click on 'MegaDetectorGUI', 'Program', 'RUN_GUI' with the flamingo icon. This should open the application, where the process of using the MegaDetector is explained :)
